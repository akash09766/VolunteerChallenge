# Free Now ðŸš– Andorid Task

**This app is part of task given by [FreeNow](https://free-now.com/de-en/ride/).The main aim of this app is to demonstrate how to build Modern Android application.**

The app focuses ðŸ‘“ on following key things:
- Code structuring
- MVVM Architecture
- Unidirectional Data Flow
- Dependency injection ðŸ—¡
- Kotlin + Coroutines
- And tests ðŸ› 

The idea is to keep the app super simple while demonstrating new libraries and tools which makes it easier to build high quality Android applications.

## Libraries and tools ðŸ› 

App uses libraries and tools used to build Modern Android application, mainly part of Android Jetpack ðŸš€

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) first
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) first
- Android Architecture components
- [Dagger 2](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) for dependency injection ðŸ—¡
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- Other [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) components

## Architecture

The app uses MVVM architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability.
